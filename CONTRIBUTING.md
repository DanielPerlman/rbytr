rbytr is an open source project and we love to receive contributions!

# Introduction

First, thank you for considering contributing to rbytr! It's people like you that make rbytr great.

We welcome any type of contribution, not only code. You can help with 
- **QA**: file bug reports, the more details you can give the better (e.g. screenshots with the console open)
- **rbytr**: use the rbytr app and engage with other rbytrs by pre-liking and pre-sharing posts you find worth spreading.
- **Mattermost**: discuss and propose improvements via [rbytr.co](http://rbytr.co) and [mattermost.rbytr.co](http://mattermost.rbytr.co)
- **Marketing**: writing blog posts, use cases, sharing success stories.
- **Code**: there are plenty of [open issues](https://github.com/rbytr/rbytr/issues). Even if you can't write code, commenting on them, showing that you care about a given issue matters. It helps us triage them.

# Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to rbytr? You can start by looking through these issues:
[Issues](https://github.com/rbytr/rbytr/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Acomments-desc) - all open issues.
While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

# Submitting code

Any code change should be submitted as a pull request. The description should explain what the code does and give steps to execute it. The pull request should also contain tests.

# Code review process

The bigger the pull request, the longer it will take to review and merge. Try to break down large pull requests in smaller chunks that are easier to review and merge.

If it's a bug fix, it will probably be quickly merged and deployed. If it's a new feature, we will probably ask to limit it to your own collective as a start to see how it goes before releasing it to all other collectives.
