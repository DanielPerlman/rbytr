  <h4>Exemption from Liability:</h4>
  <br/>
  Liability for Content 
  <br/>
  The contents of the 'web pages' and the
  newsletter are prepared with the upmost care. The provider accepts
  no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or timeliness of
  the content. The use of the content of the 'web pages' is at the
  user's own risk. Contributions mentioned by name reflect the opinion
  of the author and not necessarily the opinion of the provider. As a
  service provider we are responsible according to &sect; 7 paragraph 1 of
  TMG for our own contents on these pages under the general law.
  According to &sect;&sect; 8 to 10 TMG, we are not obligated as a service
  provider to monitor transmitted or stored information, or to
  investigate circumstances that suggest an illegal activity.
  Obligations to remove or block the use of information remain, in
  accordance with legal regulations, unaffected. Any liability in this
  respect can be assumed only from the moment that knowledge of the
  specific breach of law is obtained. In the event that the
  corresponding violations become known, we shall remove these
  contents immediately. 
  <br/><br/>
  Liability for Links
  <br/>
  Our offer contains links
  to external websites operated by third parties, on whose contents we
  have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume liability for these
  contents. Instead, it is the relevant supplier or operator of the
  linked web pages who is responsible for the content of these pages.
  The linked pages were inspected for possible legal infringements at
  the time the link was established. At the time of linking, no
  unlawful contents were detectable. Permanent monitoring of the
  content of the linked pages is infeasible without any specific
  indication of an infringement of rights. In the event that
  corresponding violations become known, we shall remove the
  corresponding links immediately. 
  Copyright The contents on these
  websites, as prepared and displayed by its operator, are subject to
  German copyright law. Their duplication, processing, distribution,
  or any form of commercialization beyond the scope of the copyright
  law requires the written consent of the respective author or
  creator. Copies and downloads are allowed solely for private and
  non-commercial purposes. Insofar as this page's contents were not
  created by its operator, third-party copyrights will be respected
  and observed. Should you still have reason to believe that a
  copyright violation has occurred despite the precautionary measures
  taken, we kindly ask you to notify us. In the event that the
  corresponding violations become known, we shall remove this content
  immediately.
  <br/><br/>
  Data and Privacy Protection/Data Privacy 
  <br/>
  Generally, the
  use of our website is possible without the need to provide personal
  data. When you are asked to provide personal data (e.g., name,
  address or e-mail address), this is, as far as possible, optional
  for you. We do not pass this information to third parties without
  your explicit agreement. Please note that the transmission of data
  via the Internet (e.g., e-mail communication) can be insecure. A
  complete protection against access through third parties is not
  possible. The use of published contact information within the
  disclosure to transmit unwanted advertising or other marketing
  material shall be expressly excluded. The provider of these pages
  explicitly reserve the right to take legal action in case of
  receiving unwanted advertising, e.g., via junk mail.
  <br/>Data Privacy
  Protection When Using Google Analytics
  <br/>
  This web page uses Google
  Anylytics, a website statistics service provided by Google Inc.
  based in Mountain View, USA ("Google"). Google Analytics uses
  'cookies', text files stored on your computer which allow an
  analysis of your use of the website. The information about your use
  of this web page generated by the cookies, will be passed on to and
  stored by Google on a server in the United States. Google provides
  IP anonymization (so-called IP masking) and this is activated on
  this website. Google will therfore shorten your IP address within
  member states of the European Union and other member states of the
  European Economic Area (EEA). Only on rare occasions, the entire IP
  address will be transmitted to and then abbreviated by a US Google
  server. On behalf of the this web pages operator, Google will use
  the information in order to evaluate your use of the site, and to
  compile reports on website activities. Moreover, information
  concerning usage of the web pages and internet use will be gathered
  to offer further services to this pages' operator. The IP address
  transmitted will not be linked to any other Google data. By setting
  your browser accordingly, you may block the storage of cookies.
  Furthermore, you can deny collection of the cookie-related data and
  any information related to your use of this website (including your
  IP address) to be processed by Google, by downloading and installing
  the appropriate browser plug-ins: <a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger" target="__blank">https://www.eff.org/privacybadger</a>,
